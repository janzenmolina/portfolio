									<h2>ACM at UCSD Website</h2>
									<p>A computing club website that makes it easy and engaging to connect with other students</p>
								</header>
								<p>
										<b>Team:</b> Faris Ashai (VP of Development), Tiffany Lee (Mentor), Janzen Molina, Ryan Xu
									</p>

										<h3>Challenge</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										For students, there are several options when it comes to uploading a resume, but with most options, they can only hope that their resume is viewed by recruiters and not immediately rejected by the perceived “automated resume screenings”. For this reason, many students tend to neglect trying to apply for jobs or internships out of fear of rejection or their assumptions that they would “never make it even if they tried”.
									</p>
									<h4>Objective</h4>
									<p>
										As fellow students that face these same hopes and fears, we were eager to develop a solution. Using ACM at UCSD’s vast network of recruiters and industry connections, we can add a resume upload feature to our membership website that helps bring more peace of mind in letting students know that their work is being recognized.

										<h3>Stakeholders</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										<b>Primary stakeholders:</b> New and returning members of ACM at UCSD <br>
										<b>Secondary stakeholders:</b> Club board members that want to upload a resume but also want to access the database of stored resumes to send to recruiters <br>
										<b>Tertiary stakeholders:</b> Recruiters and other industry personnel that will interact with board members and receive the stored resumes
									</p>

										<h3>Research Questions</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										1. What are the needs of people looking to upload their resume on a website?<br>
										2. What barriers stop students from uploading their resume to a website?<br>
										3. On other websites, how do users upload their resume? What methods of uploading are students accustomed to?<br>
										4. What prevents recruiters from seeing a student’s resume?<br>
										5. What would make the process of handing off a resume from student to recruiter more transparent?<br>

										<h3>Competititve Analysis</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Competitive analysis was done against 4 websites with features resembling that of a resume upload service:<br>
										1. Indeed, an all-encompassing employment website for job seekers of all ages<br>
										2. Handshake, a job site with specific resources for college students<br>
										3. UCSD Employment, a career finder for UCSD students, alumni and general working professionals<br>
										4. Jobscan, an applicant tracking system (ATS) resume checker<br></p>

									<p class="gallery-description">Source: Wikimedia Commons</p>
									<p>Indeed had the least friction for a user to upload a resume in terms of number of clicks while supporting the feature with encouraging external content. However, the broader scope of Indeed's target audience can be discouraging for students due to outside competition. Additionally, Indeed gave us no insight into uploading multiple resumes as the user's profile cannot hold more than one at a time.</p>
									<img class="article-image" style="width: 20%; margin-top: 2em;" src="images/acm-handshake.png" alt="Handshake logo">
									<p class="gallery-description">Source: Handshake</p>
									<p>Meanwhile, Handshake gave us a better understanding of a proper multi-resume upload and table view that we could implement into the admin perspective. Additionally, the student-centric theme of the website gives us an idea of what to include in order to maintain user positivity towards sharing their resume with others. From a user's perspective, though, Handshake took the longest number of clicks which could prove to be frustrating for newer users.
									<img class="article-image" style="width: 30%; margin-top: 2em;" src="images/acm-ucsdemployment.png" alt="UCSD Employment logo">
									<p class="gallery-description">Source: employment.ucsd.edu</p>
									<p>The UCSD Employment website demonstrated how to properly instill confidence in users by means of name recognition, which we can implement on our website through sponsorship brands. Beyond that, we found that there was an importance in creating some sort of direct contact with the company being contacted, which this website did not have.</p>
									<img class="article-image" style="width: 20%; margin-top: 2em;" src="images/acm-jobscan.png" alt="Jobscan logo">
									<p class="gallery-description">Source: Jobscan</p>
									<p>Although not a directly related website, Jobscan helped the team imagine future experimental features in terms of what the users could be able to do with their resume. Additionally, the site allowed for uploading the resume directly from the landing page, which we can try to use on our own site in order to reduce time taken to complete the resume upload flow. The website also highlighted the importance of an aesthetically pleasing website as a variety of inconsistencies and glitches in the UI made it unappealing to use.</p>

										<h3>Initial Prototypes</h3>
									</header>
									<p> These initial prototypes were made as a means of demonstrating to the development team how the first iteration of the feature should appear on the website. These are not yet based on user needs- instead, they were meant to maintain the style of the existing website.</p>
